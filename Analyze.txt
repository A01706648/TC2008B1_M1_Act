During Execution
Case 1:
    We are running Map of 30X40
    with 5 roborts, 25 dirt
    execution step is 923, 
    100% cleaned, 
    number of movement is 4615

Case 2:
    We are running Map of 30X40
    with 25 roborts, 25 dirt
    execution step is 320, 
    100% cleaned, 
    number of movement is 8000

Analyze:
When there is MORE agents, LESS time will spend
When there is MORE agents, MORE movement will take

Because more agent will increase the chance to get the dirt, means the dirt will be found faster
in the same time, more agent means more random total move will be there, so the more total movement will take

Improvement:
Since the movement is random, it means the movement is not efficent.
We need to make the routin more clean to let robot know.
We can guid the direction of the robot by nearest dirt's location, instead of randomly
Also, before robot take the direction, we shall check the available diretion robot can go,
and avoid the stuck situation.
